# Jack Operating System

## Background
This Jack Operating System can be viewed as an extension of a high-level programming language. It includes Memory Access, Heap Management, Mathematical Operations, Graphics, Keyboard Input, etc.

## Executions

The commands that I used to test those Jack code.

`cd nand2tetris/projects/12`

`cp -f String.jack StringTest/`

`bash -x ../../tools/JackCompiler.sh StringTest/`

Then, run `VMEmulator.sh` for testing.
